# 7DtD_PL

This is a Polish translation project for 7 Days to Die.

Instant folder, contain "language pack" which takes effect immediately after user overwrite the files.

For Steam folder, contain "language pack" for TFP devs if them will be interested in adding new language to the base game (next language avivable through Steam language selector under Properties menu). For now it's contain a original localization txts and modified xmls. I'll update the txts when I create full Instant language pack.
